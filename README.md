# Rock-Paper-Scissors-using-UDP-Protocol-Java

This project is an online Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Java networking. In this game application, there will be 2 clients and a server which they are connected to. Each client has an interacative interface where the user can has to enter his name to join the game. Later, the user will be directed to another screen where he can select the options between ROCK PAPER SCISSORS. For each selection, the server passes the message of each choice between two users calculating who has one for that particular selection.

This goes on for 5 rounds and ultimately shows the result in each user's screen who the winner is?
